Hello there, my name is Allen Taewon Lim and I am a computer scientist focusing on test automation and macOS (mostly security). I studied at California State University, Northridge and received my B.S. in Computer Science in the fall of 2021.

I am also working on many personal projects such as utilizing microk8s and various SBCs to create a mobile workstation that goes wherever I go. For this, I am using the Raspberry Pi 400, the Raspberry Pi 4, and the Lattepanda Delta (for x86 servers). I am planning to use a mobile power supply with USB PD and a GL.INet router.

I also have another Raspberry Pi with a home assistant working as the bridge for my IoT devices, like generic IoT plugs with Tuya cloud support. I am planning to use my ESP32-E board and Matter firmware from Github to make an IR signal sender so I can eventually make a machine remote controllable with the home assistant.
